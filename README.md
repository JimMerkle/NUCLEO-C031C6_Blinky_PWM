NUCLEO-C031C6_Blinky_PWM

Example project for "Blinky" using PWM on a NUCLEO-C013C6 board.
Support for printf() provided.  Just open the USB serial device that enumerates when
the NUCLEO board is plugged into a host computer, example COM5.  I use TeraTerm for this.

I removed the default (unused) UART1 and I2C configuration.
